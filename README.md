# StayinAwake
A simple app for iOS developers that will keep your device's screen awake while Xcode is building your app so you don't have to unlock your device when the build is finished.

## How to install
This app is not on the App Store, so you need to build and install it on your device yourself.
1. Clone this repository
1. Open the project in Xcode
1. Build and run StayinAwake on your device
1. Every once in a while the build will expire and the app will begin crashing at startup. In this case, just repeat steps 1-3.

## Usage
Just run the app on your device. As long as it's running in the foreground, the device will not sleep.
